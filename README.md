# Primitive RTS â€“ A Simple 2D Real-Time Strategy Game

This project is a straightforward demonstration of a tile-based RTS game developed in Java. It features:

- **Randomly Generated Map:** A grid-based map with grass and water tiles.
- **Basic Resource System:** A simple control panel showing your current gold.
- **Unit Management:** Units that can be spawned, selected by dragging a selection box, and moved via right-click commands.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Code:** Ensure all the `.java` files are compiled.
2. **Run the Game:** Execute the `MainMenu` class and start the game from there. The settings dialog allows choosing between 1000x700 and 1920x1080 resolutions.

## Gameplay Instructions

- **Unit Selection:** Drag with the left mouse button to select units.
- **Unit Movement:** Right-click to command selected units to move to the desired location.
- **Spawn Units:** Click the "Spawn Unit" button on the control panel to add a new unit, which will deduct some gold from your resources.
- **Construct Buildings:** Use the "Build" button to place Barracks, Resource Depots, or Towers on open grass tiles. Right-click a Barracks to queue new units.
- **Game Menu:** Press `Esc` during gameplay to open a context menu where you can resume or return to the main menu.

This project serves as a basic foundation for more advanced RTS mechanics and gameplay features.
